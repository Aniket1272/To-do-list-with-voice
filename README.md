# To-do-list-with-voice

To-do list with voice is created with python. I have used gTTS, playsound, os etc. libraries for making this project. It will help you to make virtual voice based to-do list. You can enter your tasks and after completing it you can remove it easily and check remaining tasks by voice response of this.
